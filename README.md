# Sobel_Filter
The project has Python 3.6 implementations of the 2-D and 1-D Sobel operators in sobel2d.py and sobel1d.py files respectively.

The goal of the project was to perform manual convolution so users can better understand the mechanics of the Sobel operator.

## Required Libraries
To run the sobel2d.py and sobel1d.py files, the following libraries must be installed:
* PIL v6.2
* Numpy v1.16.3
* Matplotlib v3.1.1 (for visualization only)

## Results
Some of the images ouputted by the code are shown in the results folder.
